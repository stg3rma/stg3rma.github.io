My two jQuery-driven interactive elements in the form include: 

1) Name, Email and Message are required fields. Click in a field and help text will ask user to enter the information. 

2) Select an item from the dropdown or radio set for subscribe and a message will appear thanking user.

My site’s click effect is:

1) When the required fields (name, email & message) on the contact form are filled out and the form is submitted the blue envelope glyphicon is animated off the page to the right and increases in transparency then a modal window pops up with a thank you message.

My site’s hover effect is:

1) Hover over any of the images and the image treatement changes from Bootstrap's img-rounded to img-circle. For the image of the desk, the image will change to a version of the desk with the slant-front open.

My if/else choice is: 

1) Email is a required field on the contact form. I added a reqex expression to check if the text entered is a valid email address. If is not a message displays asking the user to enter a valid email.

My effect that requires filtering the results is:
